# Conceptual Pre-release of Hardcore-Industry Mod
## Introduction to Hardcore-Industry Mod
**Hardcore-Industry** Mod is a Minecraft mod based on Fabric, which has gameplay similar to various technology mods. However, in reality, it leans towards a combination of Industrial Craft 2, Tech Reborn, GregTech, and Immersive Engineering, with beautiful multi-block structures, complex and realistic industrial processes, making it ** *extremely* ** hardcore and challenging. But please remember that **Hardcore-Industry** always seeks to increase difficulty without changing the original game mechanics of Minecraft. Therefore, **Hardcore-Industry** will not change any game mechanics such as gravity. However, due to its pursuit of hardcore, creating some common items will be extremely complex. Therefore, **Hardcore-Industry** may introduce clearer game guides and list all consumables for each item for the convenience of players in crafting.
## Development Progress of Hardcore-Industry Mod
Currently, **Hardcore-Industry** Mod is in the conceptual pre-release stage, and its designer is working on designing the game process and direction. The construction of the **Hardcore-Industry** code may begin after August 2023, so it will take some time before Hardcore-Industry is released. Please be patient and stay tuned. If you encounter any bugs or omissions while playing, please submit an ISSUE to Github: https://github.com/Shenhyuu/Hardcore-Industry .
